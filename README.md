NoSpoilers is a webapp for safely browsing wikis free of spoilers.  You select a TV series, and what episode you have
seen up to, and it provides a portal with which to browse a wiki without risk of seeing a spoiler.

It will work by browsing the latest wiki page histories no later than the first unaired episode of the show.
